## Anaconda Basic commands
Create new environment for a new package (substitute package_name with random_facts for first try):  
 conda create -n package_name python=3  
 source activate package_name  
 source deactivate package_name  
 conda install numpy pandas matplotlib  
 conda install jupyter notebook  
 conda list  
Saving environment: conda env export > environment.yaml  
Creating environment from saved file: conda env create -f environment.yaml  
Show all environment created: conda env list  
Remove environment: conda env remove -n env_name
